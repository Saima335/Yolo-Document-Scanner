# Document Image Scanner using YOLO

## Project Overview
### Purpose
The Document Image Scanner utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for precise object detection and segmentation in scanned documents. It is designed to optimize detection on plain white backgrounds and low-contrast surfaces, ensuring accurate extraction of document elements.

## Features
- YOLO-based object detection for identifying document components.
- Optimized algorithms for improved performance on low-contrast surfaces.
- Enhanced segmentation techniques for precise element extraction.

## Project Structure
- **Colab Notebooks**: Core data processing and model training for object detection and segmentation.
- **Models**: Pre-trained YOLO models and fine-tuned weights for document scanning.
- **Dataset**: Sample images and annotated datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Research Questions
- How does YOLO improve document object detection compared to traditional methods?
- What optimizations enhance detection accuracy on low-contrast backgrounds?
- How can segmentation be improved for better document element extraction?
